            <h2>About ME</h2>
            <p>My name is Joe but i have been going by Joey my whole life, I have always 
                felt that Joey is a bit more fun and doesn't take life to serious thus why I go by Joey for I feel it
                fills out my personality well.  I was born and raised in San Antonio, TX
                and to be honest especially right now I kinda wish I lived up north, for This
                flower is wilting.  My background includes Army, Mechanic, Nurse and now
                I am pursuing coding.  Although I have done a lot in my life i have come to the realization that
                all the jobs i have ever had have involed using my critical thinking skills, whether 
                it is finding why a satilite wont work, to why a client blood sugar is rising, to
                now of why isn't this code working.
