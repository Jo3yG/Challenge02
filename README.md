# Challenge02
Portfolio
# Description
This Challenge is to create our own portfolio with what we have worked with and what we know so far, there were certain criteria we needed to follow in order to make it complete. We started with no code and needed to creat our own index.html as well as style.css from scratch.
# Code
The code was started from scratch, zero code to start from.
# Work
The work was very challenging to start from scratch, the work includes a title with my name, underneath with a nav bar that will follow if you scroll, as well as the links in the nav bar will take you to the coresponding sections. The sections include a picture of me, About ME, School, Projects, Contact. In the contact section includes ways to sontact me, in the projects section includes links to my GitHub and URL for my past projects.
